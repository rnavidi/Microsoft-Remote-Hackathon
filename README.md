# Microsoft-Remote-Hackathon
In a three days hackathon, we as a 5 people team, built an application which is a Meditation and Yoga app that you can practice simultaneously with other members of family, colleagues, and peers remotely. Not only others can watch you through the camera, but also it has a pose detection feature that will guide you as a mentor for preventing any injuries.
